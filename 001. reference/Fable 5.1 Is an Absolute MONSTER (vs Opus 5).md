00:00 Hey guys, so in this video,
00:03 we're gonna be testing Fable 5.1.
00:05 And I'm super excited about this one,
00:08 because until now,
00:09 I still think that Fable 5
00:11 was the best model that ever existed.
00:13 So I'm really happy to see the upgrade.
00:16 And the way we're gonna test it is simple.
00:18 We take Opus 5,
00:20 we give both of them the same job,
00:22 and see who builds it better.
00:24 Quickly about the benchmarks.
00:26 The new one takes pretty much every row.
00:29 But here is the thing.
00:30 None of these rows tell you if a model
00:32 can build something
that actually looks good.
00:35 And that's the only thing
I care about in this video.
00:38 And now look at the price.
00:40 Because Fable is twice
as expensive as Opus per token,
00:43 but reading from cache went
00:45 from $1 down to $0.25.
00:48 And I know that looks like
00:50 the most boring line on this whole table,
00:52 but trust me, by the end of this video,
00:55 that one line is gonna surprise all of us.
00:58 Okay, there we go.
00:59 Both models will use
Godot as a game engine
01:02 and Blender to model anything,
01:04 plus texture scans if it wants to.
01:06 But what do we do? We chill.
01:09 Just some night,
01:10 forest and mutants.
01:11 First step, a treehouse.
01:13 No polygon limit. Two hours.
01:15 Make it stunning.
01:17 Alright, so here we are in Blender,
01:20 so let's have a closer look.
01:22 I like Fable's one.
01:23 It used the scans really well.
01:26 The color sits together
01:27 nicely and the tree feels just massive.
01:30 Now Opus. The geometry is similar,
01:32 but I just like the colors less.
01:35 By the way, look at the leaves.
01:37 Fable didn't draw its leaves.
01:38 It just took the real scans of it
01:41 and clustered it on a flat rectangle.
01:44 Opus, though,
it didn't use any photos at all.
01:47 Okay, treehouse is done,
and in my opinion,
01:50 this round goes to Fable 5.1.
01:53 Next stage is the fire,
01:54 made from scratch in Godot.
01:57 And here I was really impressed.
01:59 Just look at it.
02:01 Fable's fire is one of the best fires
02:03 I have seen in games.
02:06 And I don't mean one
of the best AI-made ones.
02:09 I mean one of the best.
02:10 The coals, the core, the tongues,
02:12 like every layer is epic.
02:15 And I can crank it up and it still holds.
02:18 Like I'm so impressed.
02:20 Really.
02:21 And this is Opus 5.
02:23 Yes, you can see the triangles.
02:26 And that's the whole difference.
02:27 Fable's fire doesn't have a shape.
02:30 Opus 5 fire does.
02:32 And you can just see it.
02:34 So the verdict is really simple.
02:36 Fable 5.1 just gapped Opus 5 a lot.
02:41 Okay, so we have a treehouse
and we have the fire.
02:44 But everything around is empty,
02:46 so the next big step is to fill it.
02:48 And both of them started
in the same place,
02:50 writing the sky from scratch.
02:52 Okay, and both of these are fine.
02:55 Honestly, both of them work.
02:56 So let's put some vegetation.
02:58 And this is the same
story as the treehouse.
03:01 Fable went and got real leaves,
03:03 actual scans,
and built his trees out of these.
03:06 Opus, though,
created the leaves from scratch.
03:08 But on its own, that means nothing.
03:11 What matters is how it looks in the scene.
03:13 This is Fable's. And I love this.
03:16 Look at the light.
03:17 The fire is doing the work.
03:19 Everything around it falls off into black.
03:20 And that's what gives you depth.
03:22 The trees, the stones,
like all of the props,
03:25 they sit in the dark
and they just feel real.
03:28 And this is Opus.
03:29 And the assets are not a problem.
03:31 The light is a problem.
03:33 Basically, its moon is
three times brighter than Fable's
03:36 and it just lights the whole
forest with the sky itself,
03:40 so the fire doesn't give any mood.
03:42 Based on that, again,
03:44 this round goes to Fable 5.1.
03:48 Now it's time to fill
the forest with cannibals.
03:50 Both of them modeled this in Blender.
03:53 But for the animations,
they went completely different ways.
03:56 Fable rigged it
and animated it in Blender,
03:58 so Godot just plays the clips back.
04:01 Opus, though,
chopped his model into pieces
04:03 and moved them with code,
04:05 like, live in the engine.
04:07 Yes, Fable is much better.
04:08 But I wanted to see
if this could be pushed further,
04:11 so we changed the approach.
04:13 Instead of building a body out of boxes,
04:15 they sculpted it out of blobs
that melt into each other.
04:19 And suddenly, you get shoulders,
04:21 and ribs, and a spine.
04:23 And for the animation,
we went with motion capture,
04:26 which is just a free database
04:27 of movement somebody already recorded.
04:30 And the files open straight in Blender,
04:32 so no plugin, nothing.
04:34 And it moves like a person,
because it was a person.
04:36 And now Opus 5 is much closer to Fable.
04:40 But I still think that Fable won this one.
04:44 Alright guys, time for some gameplay.
04:46 And let's start with Fable's game.
04:48 And just look at these textures,
04:50 nothing looks stretched.
04:51 And we have the bow, so let's test it out.
04:54 And there is the animation,
04:55 and the arrow sticks into the tree,
04:57 which is an amazing touch.
04:60 Here is the fireplace,
05:02 that's my favorite part.
05:03 And the cannibals are here too,
05:05 they just climbed the ladder to get me.
05:07 So we use bow, and yeah, there we go.
05:11 And look at the death animation,
05:12 that's actually so funny.
05:14 Okay, let's go down. We need to get some
05:16 wood to keep the fire going,
05:18 I think that's the purpose of the game.
05:21 And wow,
the plants looks really good down here.
05:24 And the game actually runs really smooth,
05:26 like 60 FPS or something like that, I
05:28 didn't notice any lagging.
05:30 Alright, some wood, let's take it back up.
05:37 And done, we put it into fire,
05:39 and I think that we
just survived the night.
05:43 That was Fable's game,
05:44 and it's so impressive that it
was built from nothing.
05:48 Alright, let's try the Opus 5 game.
05:51 Okay, straight away this looks much worse,
05:54 it feels like coming from a PS5 game
05:56 to a PS3 game, really.
05:58 Like I said during the environment stage,
06:00 the lighting is the weakness here.
06:03 And the plants are so tall actually,
06:05 and dense that I just cannot
see anything where I'm going.
06:14 But honestly, I love the mutants.
06:16 For me, this part is a tie with Fable.
06:21 And yeah, we are dead, somehow.
06:23 Okay, let's try one more time,
06:25 and we speedrun straight to the wood.
06:30 Okay, got it, let's back to the fire.
06:32 And there we go, we are safe, I think.
06:34 So after playing both games,
06:36 Fable 5.1 is the clear winner here.
06:39 It looks much better,
06:40 and I had more fun playing it.
06:42 This one wasn't even close,
06:44 but there is the biggest surprise.
06:46 The cost.
06:47 Fable 5.1 was actually cheaper.
06:50 The estimated API cost
was about $380 for Fable,
06:54 compared to almost $400 for Opus.
06:57 And that's because of cache read cost.
06:59 50 cents per million token for Opus,
07:01 and 25 cents for Fable.
07:03 That sounds tiny,
but with hundreds of millions of tokens,
07:06 it just adds up.
07:07 So in this test,
07:09 Fable gave me a better game
for slightly less money.
07:13 That's it for today.
