00:00 Guys, today we're gonna have a lot of fun I hope.
00:04 Do you see this?
00:05 AI made it.
00:06 And it looks terrible.
00:08 But after a week it looks like this.
00:12 In this video I will show you exactly how to get from that to this.
00:17 Every step I will skip nothing.
00:19 But first numbers.
00:20 One week, four models.
00:22 More than a hundred agents and I just stop counting.
00:25 And I think that we just use enough power to light a small town, like really.
00:30 But I don't regret a single token.
00:33 Before we cook, we start with the basics.
00:36 You asked for this in the last video, so this time I will go deeper.
00:40 My setup is simple.
00:42 I'm using Visual Studio Code with three extensions, Claude Code, Kimi Code and Codex.
00:47 And honestly, Claude Code did most of the work here.
00:50 We will use Godot Engine for the game and Blender for the models.
00:55 And nothing else.
00:55 And during this video I'm gonna show you how I actually get my agents stuck with Blender.
01:02 And also how I work with the Godot files with my models.
01:05 Okay, so how to start.
01:07 And that's a valid question.
01:09 Well, you need an idea.
01:11 And this one is mine.
01:13 I wanted to create a small sci-fi game where you play as an astronaut on the
01:17 station.
01:18 And at the end, something goes wrong.
01:21 Guys, if you like my content, just hit the subscribe button.
01:24 I would appreciate it.
01:27 So first, I wanted a reference.
01:29 So I asked ChatGPT for the images.
01:32 And those are the results.
01:34 Based on them, we created a color bible.
01:37 But what is a color bible?
01:38 Well, it's a list of colors.
01:40 And every model must use this.
01:43 It's a contract.
01:44 Otherwise, every model could use just different shade of gray and we don't want it.
01:49 Next step, the plan.
01:51 Now take your best model and just set it to max.
01:54 I will use Fable 5 and it will not build anything.
01:57 It just hands out the work and checks what comes back.
02:00 I called it the orchestrator.
02:02 So talk to it first.
02:04 About the game and about what you want.
02:06 So you are on the same page.
02:07 After that, just ask it for a plan.
02:10 So that's my plan.
02:12 And these are the sections.
02:13 Every section has smaller tasks inside.
02:16 That's the rule.
02:17 One task should be one fresh session.
02:19 And it must be easy to test.
02:21 So how do you test the game with AI?
02:23 I'm gonna show you how.
02:25 Ask your model to test it both ways.
02:27 First, let it measure.
02:29 You just ask it to write a small script.
02:31 The script starts the game and presses the keys.
02:34 Just simulating the real playtest.
02:36 Walks through the hallway, tries to open the door, etc.
02:39 Then it prints the numbers and just check it.
02:42 If character walks, if it can reach the door and open it.
02:46 Pass or fail.
02:47 Second method, let it look.
02:49 The same script takes screenshots along the way.
02:52 And then another agent opens them and tells you what's wrong.
02:56 For example, this room is too dark.
02:58 So combining those two methods, you have something like a playtest.
03:03 And of course, the last check is me.
03:05 Okay, step one, the grey boxes.
03:08 Before we start, I wanted to make sure that I will get what I want.
03:11 So I talked to Fable 5 what I wanted and asked first for blueprint.
03:16 And this is what I get.
03:17 And it looks correct.
03:18 After that, we could delegate this task to Opus 5.
03:21 And that's the prompt.
03:24 Okay guys, let's go for a walk.
03:26 So here we sleep.
03:28 And that's a corridor and a bridge.
03:31 It looks terrible.
03:32 And I know that it's supposed to look like this.
03:34 Now my favorite section, a greenhouse.
03:37 We will make it look stunning, I promise.
03:39 And there is an airlock and a store.
03:41 So yes, Opus 5 delivered its task and it's fully valid.
03:45 Now it will get more interesting.
03:47 We want to replace Opus 5 with modular kit from Blender.
03:51 And that's a second section.
03:53 But first, how do I actually work with Blender?
03:56 And no, I'm not using Blender MCP.
03:59 So in a nutshell, the model just writes a Python script.
04:03 Then Blender runs it headless.
04:05 But how is that even possible?
04:06 Well, Blender has a built-in Python interpreter.
04:09 So the model doesn't need a mouse at all.
04:11 It just writes a Python file.
04:14 Let me give you an example.
04:16 This line of code is a cube in Blender.
04:18 And this piece of code is a small house.
04:20 All right, so now we can move
04:22 to our modular walls Blender kit.
04:25 Let's go.
04:26 So here's the plan.
04:27 We want to split this wall into modules
04:29 and then we can build whole station based on those modules.
04:33 Okay, so here we are in Blender
04:34 and this is what Opus 5 created for us.
04:38 And this is how it connects together.
04:41 But how do we actually get results this good?
04:44 Well, we use a method called the Gauntlet Loop.
04:47 A lot of people talk about it lately
04:49 and instead of building a whole game at once
04:52 with this method, we run it on a single task.
04:54 So that's the flow.
04:55 The model that gets the task spawns a few agents,
04:58 one for each piece.
04:59 And when an agent is done,
05:01 it gives its output to an independent critic
05:04 who can accept it or send it back.
05:06 And at the same time, it gets measured against numbers.
05:09 For the wall kit, that's the dimensions.
05:11 And those kinds of sessions
05:13 sometimes last even for a few hours.
05:15 And here before and after.
05:17 So it's getting better, but still far from good.
05:20 Then we handed the next task to GPT-5-6-0.
05:24 Basically work on the props.
05:25 So all of the pipes, fans,
05:27 and this kind of things on the walls.
05:29 Just to make this station more detailed.
05:31 Same method as before, the Gauntlet Loop.
05:33 So it will run until it's good.
05:35 And here is the result in Blender.
05:37 And this is the station side by side, before and after.
05:41 And that's just the start.
05:43 Guys, but Kimi K3 is unemployed,
05:45 so he gave it a completely different task.
05:47 Work on the astronaut's hand
05:49 so he can interact with the world around us.
05:51 So the task was, model the hand and the welding torch.
05:55 Nothing fancy, just point and weld.
05:58 We will keep it for now,
05:59 but honestly, I'm not sure if it will survive.
06:03 Okay, the next step is pure pleasure.
06:06 Now we model the rooms, for real this time.
06:08 GPT went to the engine room.
06:10 Opus took the bridge, the corridor and the greenhouse.
06:13 And for the quarters, I sent Kimi.
06:15 And at the same time, I broke my own rule.
06:18 I sent Fable, our orchestrator, to build a room too.
06:21 I just wanted to see how they compare.
06:24 Okay, so we start with the quarters
06:26 and that's Kimi in Blender.
06:28 Okay, first thing I see is that everything is so square,
06:31 like the desk and the bed.
06:33 And I'm not super happy about it.
06:35 So let's see what Fable 5 did.
06:37 And yes, I can see the differences.
06:39 There are much more smooth surfaces,
06:41 which is super important to me.
06:43 Let's see how it compares in the game.
06:45 And one thing I know for sure,
06:47 I will stick with Fable 5 quarter.
06:50 Second room is the engine room that GPT-5.6 did.
06:54 And let's review it directly in the game.
06:56 Doesn't look bad,
06:57 but maybe I will iterate more over it later.
06:60 Now the bridge and guys, look at this.
07:03 It was done in Blender by Opus 5
07:05 and it's really impressive.
07:07 Just look at the amount of details here.
07:09 And that's the stunning work.
07:11 Maybe you noticed, there is already a planet out there
07:14 and that's the completely different story
07:16 and we will get to it, no worries.
07:19 But first, trees.
07:20 And here I was so surprised.
07:23 I expected simple low poly trees,
07:25 but Opus 5 came back with this
07:27 and it made three versions.
07:29 The first one was almost perfect,
07:30 but look at the leaves.
07:31 They are just triangles.
07:33 The second one has better leaves,
07:35 but the umbrella kind of lost its shape.
07:37 And the third version, best proportions.
07:40 Look at this one.
07:41 All right, let's see how it looks like in the station.
07:43 It already looks stunning.
07:45 And the best part is that we have not even
07:47 touched the final lighting yet.
07:50 Okay, a quick one about space.
07:52 First, Opus 5 modeled the ship.
07:55 We put it into the void,
07:57 but this planet was made in Godot and looked terrible.
08:00 So I decided to download the only ready-made model
08:04 in this whole project,
08:05 license-free and beautiful.
08:07 That's before and after.
08:09 And our ship fits this planet perfectly.
08:13 The next big milestone is the astronaut.
08:15 So first, we let Opus 5 model it
08:17 and it came back with four proposals.
08:20 And I took the second one because I just like it the most.
08:23 Now the hard part.
08:24 How do you make this guy move?
08:26 And technically we could skip it
08:28 because a lot of first-person games
08:29 just don't show the body, just show hands.
08:32 But I wanted to test what AI can really do.
08:35 So we took the hard way.
08:37 Well, usually you do this in Blender.
08:39 You build a skeleton, you tell the model
08:41 which part follows which bone
08:42 and then you record the movement pose by pose.
08:45 The game just plays it back, but we did none of that.
08:49 What we did is we split the guy
08:51 into 41 separate solid pieces connected by 17 joints.
08:55 There is no skeleton in that file
08:57 and there is not a single animation frame in it.
09:00 Everything you will see this guy is doing
09:02 is calculated by the code in Godot in every single frame.
09:07 Okay, something is wrong here, I think.
09:09 Bro, he's just cheating on the floor.
09:11 Well, he has all the parts,
09:13 but nobody told him what to do.
09:15 So let's take him to the lab and teach him how to walk.
09:18 And this is the lab.
09:20 One room, one straight line and eight attempts.
09:23 Everything you see here is state the walk was really in
09:25 including the ones that were wrong.
09:27 So that's actually super fun to see how it progressed.
09:38 And that's a final comparison.
09:40 And I think that it's good enough for now.
09:42 And there is also turning around.
09:45 All right, let's test it in our spaceship.
09:47 On purpose, I changed the camera to third person
09:50 to see how it looked like.
09:52 And it's genuinely good enough.
09:54 I would leave it as it is, so approve.
09:57 But we have another issue now.
09:59 Do you remember the glove
10:00 and the welding torch Kimi K3 did?
10:02 Yes, now it's a separate hand.
10:05 So what we need to do is basically make the astronaut
10:08 model hand to do everything, not a separate one.
10:11 And for this one, we also had several attempts,
10:14 but finally we were able to get this.
10:17 And I'm happy with the result.
10:19 The next big thing was textures.
10:21 And I had a choice.
10:22 Keep assets as they are
10:23 or actually texture the whole station.
10:25 And I went for it, mostly out of curiosity.
10:28 So we run a few tests.
10:29 First, we try to make them in code.
10:32 Straight in Godot.
10:33 No photos, just noise in a shader.
10:35 Then I wanted to see how far that is from the real thing.
10:38 So we dropped in textures from Poly Haven
10:40 and put them side by side.
10:42 And the Poly Haven ones, it's not one picture.
10:45 It's color plus a map that says where the surface is rough
10:48 and where it's polished.
10:49 And the one that changed everything for us was roughness.
10:52 And the biggest lever isn't texture at all.
10:54 It's how big it is on the wall.
10:56 Same panel, wrong scale and it reads as concrete.
10:59 Even that Poly Haven textures looks really good.
11:02 I decided to keep the project pure
11:04 so we stick with our code generated textures.
11:07 Let's talk about lighting
11:08 because that's what keeps the game smooth.
11:11 Opus 5 prepared a set of presets.
11:14 And on the right, there is a panel
11:15 with every settings behind them.
11:17 So I can see what each one actually does.
11:20 We start with the gray box.
11:21 And that's not a dark mode.
11:23 That's no lamp on at all.
11:25 This is how the station looked before any lighting work.
11:29 Then we have a day.
11:30 It's warm above and cool down at the floor.
11:33 Nothing crazy.
11:34 The sitting almost goes out and turns cold.
11:37 And you are walking on the floor strips.
11:39 Maintenance.
11:40 It's the brightest one.
11:41 It's something like I need to see what I'm doing.
11:44 Light.
11:45 And finally emergency.
11:47 That's my favorite.
11:49 The ceiling goes off completely
11:50 and red is the only color left.
11:52 It looks stunning.
11:54 Then we have a brownout.
11:56 It's the power failing.
11:57 Everything is flickering basically.
11:59 And finally blackout.
12:01 But it never goes fully black.
12:02 You are left with a line on the floor and the door.
12:06 So after adding all those lights,
12:08 we had a problem.
12:09 And not a small one.
12:11 Less than 30 fps.
12:13 So we started debugging what is causing that.
12:16 And it was obviously the light.
12:17 Because switching it off doubled the frames.
12:19 Just like that.
12:20 And after some time,
12:21 GPT 5.6 came back with the reason.
12:24 It was shadows.
12:25 Every lamp that makes a shadow
12:26 makes the game paint the whole room again.
12:29 From the lamp's side.
12:30 So for my eyes it was 600 pieces.
12:33 For the shadows 14,000.
12:35 So we stopped doing most of that.
12:37 Kept the light and the corridor went from 30 fps to 50.
12:41 But guys, like I said before in this little story,
12:45 something has to go wrong.
12:46 And right now there is nothing that can hurt you.
12:48 So we need enemies.
12:50 And I went with spiders.
12:51 And not just because they are creepy.
12:53 But because a spider is really a movement problem.
12:57 Eight legs and every single one of them
12:58 has to find the floor on its own.
13:00 So it's something you can actually code.
13:02 But first, Blender.
13:04 Fable gave this one to Kimi K3.
13:06 Who built the first pass of both of them.
13:08 And then simply ran out of budget.
13:11 So Opus 5 took it over and finished them.
13:13 Two different ideas at the same time.
13:15 Left and right.
13:16 And I went with the right one.
13:18 Let's see him in our test scene.
13:20 Okay, he can walk already.
13:22 So that's a good start.
13:24 Let's just skip the test room
13:26 and put three of them straight into the game.
13:29 And for the first few seconds, it actually looks solid.
13:32 And then well, they just started flying.
13:35 So I took them back to the lab.
13:36 And the first thing I asked Opus 5 was not a fix.
13:40 It was a button.
13:41 One that moves the animal one leg at a time.
13:44 So I can stop everything and see what it is really doing.
13:47 And the walking itself is fine.
13:49 The problem is on every surface change.
13:51 For example, floor to wall, wall to ceiling.
13:54 And there the body goes first.
13:56 And the legs just can't keep up.
13:58 So Opus 5 started iterating.
13:60 And this iteration is where we stopped.
14:02 And honestly, this is good enough.
14:04 Alright guys, time for the story.
14:07 I wanted to make actually something happen in this small game.
14:10 So the story goes like this.
14:12 The meteor hits the ship.
14:14 And our astronaut has to fix the ship from the outside.
14:17 At the same time, our dangerous and illegal cargo
14:20 in the lower deck has escaped.
14:23 That's the idea and let's just play this.
14:26 Alright, this is it.
14:27 We are on our spaceship.
14:30 Probably you're wondering where did we get those sound effects from.
14:33 Well, Opus 5 downloaded everything from Pixabay.
14:37 Free license.
14:38 So that's it.
14:40 Okay, let's go to our greenhouse.
14:42 Because I want to see that place one more time.
14:46 Okay, if someone tell me one year ago that
14:49 everything here will be built by an AI from scratch.
14:54 I wouldn't believe it, trust me.
14:56 Okay, let's hit our bridge.
14:58 And there we are.
14:60 Beautiful room.
15:05 And that's the meteor hit.
15:07 And we just went emergency mode.
15:12 That's a great mode.
15:14 Okay, so now we probably need to fix the ship on the outside.
15:19 So we are going to the airlock.
15:25 Let's close the door before we turn the wheel.
15:32 And yes, there we are on the outside.
15:34 We have magnetic shoes, so we will just not fly away.
15:39 By the way, this ladder system was one-shotted by Opus 5.
15:43 Really.
15:49 Okay, so that's our welding torch.
15:50 And that's the issue, so we will just fix it now.
15:58 That's the progress bar we have.
15:60 And we need to just do it.
16:09 Okay, perfect.
16:10 It's done.
16:11 Let's go back to the inside.
16:13 The next task on the list is to check our cargo.
16:26 That's the cargo room.
16:27 And we can see that the capsules are broken.
16:33 And those are the spiders.
16:35 I mean, it is amazing.
16:39 I love the animation of those spiders.
16:41 It is really solid.
16:46 They will try to catch me now,
16:47 so probably we will just stand here in the corridor and try to end this here.
16:53 And here they are.
16:56 One is down.
16:58 Yes, he is just levitating here.
17:00 That's the bug, but whatever.
17:03 I literally didn't test this moment before,
17:07 so that's the first time, actually.
17:10 And yes, I think we cleared the corridor.
17:17 Let's just torch him.
17:20 Okay, so that's our short game.
17:23 Hope you like it.
