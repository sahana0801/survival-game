00:00 This video will be different, because in this one, I'm gonna show you how I built this.
00:07 It was made in Godot.
00:09 And yes, it's not one prompt.
00:12 And I want to show you the whole process how I usually work with AI models.
00:17 And I'm using 4.
00:18 Fable 5, Opus 5, GPT-5.6 Sol, and Kimi K3.
00:22 And each of those models has different responsibility.
00:26 Fable 5 takes the hard calls.
00:28 What we build and why.
00:30 Opus 5 writes the mechanics and build models too.
00:34 GPT-5.6 is my Blender guy, sometimes mechanics too.
00:38 And Kimi K3 is Blender only.
00:40 It has a really good feel of aesthetics, I noticed.
00:44 So how do you start?
00:45 And that's the hard part.
00:46 I had a few of these and I finished none.
00:49 They all looked right, but none of them had a gameplay loop.
00:53 This one started the same way.
00:55 I was looking at Pinterest and that one's scene stopped me.
00:59 And I just wanted to make it a game, so badly.
01:02 So I made it a reference, not to copy it, to catch the same feeling.
01:07 And we started with a color bible.
01:09 But the picture is daylight, and I wanted the same place after dark.
01:13 So every color gets translated first.
01:16 From now on, nothing goes in the game without it.
01:19 Okay, let's make a game.
01:21 Do not ask for the whole game in one prompt.
01:23 Let the best model write the plan.
01:26 Every job then gets its own clean session.
01:29 And every job ends the same way.
01:31 A test.
01:32 If it fails, one job goes back, not the game.
01:35 So one job, one fresh chat.
01:38 The model is not carrying 9 other jobs, so it reads less, and to make fewer mistakes.
01:43 It also uses fewer tokens.
01:45 So first job on the list.
01:47 The ground.
01:48 I told Fable what I wanted.
01:50 Snow deep in one place, and thin in another.
01:53 Fable made a plan, and Opus rolled it.
01:55 It starts flat.
01:56 Completely flat.
01:57 Every corner gets asked one question.
02:00 How high are you?
02:01 A hundred and ten thousand of them, 60 times a second.
02:05 You may ask why I do not save the answers once.
02:08 Because the height keeps changing.
02:10 A boot presses the snow down, the wind builds a drift up.
02:14 And I never asked about the whole map.
02:15 Only a hundred and twenty meters of it.
02:18 And it slides along with the character.
02:20 Next house.
02:21 Some trees and a car.
02:23 These are just placeholders.
02:25 The real Blender models come later.
02:27 Then we put snow on the ground.
02:30 And remember, the ground has height.
02:32 So the snow can be deep here and thin there.
02:36 And now the snow slows you down.
02:38 Deep snow, you walk.
02:39 Thin snow, you can run.
02:41 And finally, footprints.
02:43 You can see where you walked.
02:44 It is a small thing, but it makes the world feel alive.
02:48 Behind the scenes, it works like this.
02:50 Every step paints into one picture, not a list of footprints.
02:54 One image, fixed size.
02:56 The snow reads it.
02:58 The winds erase it.
02:59 The enemy rides into the same one.
03:01 A thousand tracks goes to the same as one.
03:04 Okay, now let's replace those placeholders with real Blender models.
03:09 Nobody modeled this house by hand.
03:11 An AI model wrote a script.
03:13 Blender run it.
03:15 Every line adds one piece.
03:17 So when the roof is wrong, I do not touch the mesh.
03:20 I fix one line and run it again.
03:22 Now let's add it to the scene.
03:24 And yes, it is much better.
03:26 Let's do the same with trees and a car.
03:29 Okay, it is starting to look like a game.
03:32 If you like this video, click subscribe button.
03:35 Quick tip.
03:36 Don't ask AI for realistic meshes.
03:39 It will not deliver.
03:40 Simple shapes, it does well.
03:42 This house is just boxes and a roof.
03:45 The light does the rest and we will work on it in a second.
03:48 But first, let's replace a character placeholder with the real character.
03:53 And first, I wanted to create a concept with GPT.
03:56 So that's the prompt for GPT.
03:58 And those are the results.
03:60 And those images goes to Meshy AI.
04:02 I like to use the tool for generating a character meshes.
04:06 We have 8000 polygons, which is perfectly fine for a main character.
04:10 Okay, let's texture it.
04:11 And that's fine.
04:12 We will map the colors to our Color Bible later.
04:16 And this time I also decided to use the animations from Meshy directly.
04:20 And the rigged character looks much more simple and has like less details and a bit
04:25 different colors.
04:26 But as I said, we will fix it and it will look perfectly fine in our game.
04:31 And there it is.
04:31 Our new character is in the game.
04:33 And it looks really, really cool now.
04:35 Let's just look around.
04:37 I love those footprints.
04:38 And the fact that each footprint can have like a different depth.
04:42 And also the snow that you feel where it's deep.
04:45 Okay, so we have the character and we have all of the meshes on the map.
04:48 We will play with the light a bit.
04:51 About the lighting.
04:52 It is really helpful to ask your AI model to expose you this kind of lighting control
04:56 panel with those sliders so we can play around.
04:59 Of course, if you can't do that directly in the game engine, for example, Godot.
05:03 So here I have a few presets.
05:04 Each of them reflects a different daytime.
05:06 So let's play along.
05:08 This one is like a flat, a nightfall.
05:11 And you can see how much this scene changes.
05:14 Deep night, which is a bit lighter and a white out.
05:18 Blizzard, a lot more density of the fog and the sunrise.
05:21 I love this one.
05:22 It is really warm here.
05:26 And then pale day, midday.
05:28 So you can see how much the same scene differs based on the lighting settings.
05:34 And I love this that you can affect the game a lot this way.
05:37 And now the enemies.
05:39 I want very few of them, but every meeting should be able to kill you.
05:43 Right now there are two.
05:44 A starving man and bears.
05:46 I found the bear on Sketchfab with CC attribution and a lot of animations.
05:50 So I downloaded it.
05:52 But the bear is realistic here and we need more low poly models.
05:55 So I asked AI to decimate it in Blender.
05:57 And here you can see a three stages of decimation.
06:00 And decimation simply reducing a polygon counts.
06:03 The man sees you.
06:04 The bear smells you on the wind.
06:07 This part is still a prototype.
06:09 You press F and the gun finds the target.
06:12 The bear, you cannot outrun ever.
06:14 So it warns you first and then it charges.
06:18 It knocks you down and for now you just lie there.
06:21 Last thing I want to show you.
06:23 The house interior.
06:24 It's not a different location, it's the same one.
06:26 So player sees the danger outside the house.
06:28 How does it work?
06:30 Simple.
06:30 The moment I step inside, the roof and the front wall come off.
06:34 That's it.
06:35 But there is also another system.
06:37 When our character goes behind some object, for example a tree,
06:40 then the whole shape fades out.
06:41 How?
06:42 The camera shoots a ray at me all the time.
06:46 And that's it guys.
